synology-transcode
==================

Transcode high quality audio files automatically to mp3


Usage
=====

Create a `.synology-transcode` file in INI format in the directory you want to
run the script in, or in your user's home directory. Then run
`synology-transcode`.


Configuration Example
=====================

```ini
[directories]
sources = /some/path
  /some/other/path
target = /target/path

[filters]
includes = *.flac *.wav
excludes = @eaDir
```

- Separate source paths with newline.
- There is only one target path.
- Separate includes and excludes with spaces (yeah, boo, I know).
- Includes and excludes are optional. Above are the defaults.
- It makes sense to exclude `@eaDir`, so do that.


Nice-To-Haves
=============

- A user interface
- A background service

I'm too lazy to build them at this stage
